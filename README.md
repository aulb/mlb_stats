## Frontend
- node v8.6.0
- npm 5.4.2

To run the frontend...
`npm install`
`npm start`
Go to localhost:3000 and interact

## Missing requirements:
- 2014 years needs proxy server
- Fetch on detail click, (need to only fetch once)
- Date picker so we don't have to do previous day over and over
- Changing fave team
- Testing
- More clean up and docs
